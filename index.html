    <h2>Meditating with the Moon</h2>
    <div class="moon-meditation-text">
        <p>Planet earth is not an easy place to live. On some days it may seem to you that the universe is against you
            at times. Or on the other hand, some days thing work out as if by magic.
            Do you sometimes feel like shutting everyone out and spending the day alone in darkness? What if I told you
            that all of this is linked so very tightly to the moon and her cycles?
            That just like the tides, the moon also affect us. Aren't we, after all, made of 70$ water? </p>
        <br>
        <p> Let me start form the top. The Lunar cycle, or the trajectory the moon takes around the earth, lasts about
            28 days. During these 28 days the shadow of our earth passes over the moon, creating eight distinct <a
                href="moon-phases.html">lunar phases</a>. Each one of these lunar phases lasts about three days and are
            seen by every person on the planet. They are the same for all of us. I am sure you have read or hear at
            least once from somebody that they had a sleepless night on the full moon. This is an example of the power
            of the lunar phases.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Now what do I mean by meditating with the lunar phases? Well very simply becming aware of the phase the moon
            is currently in and taking a moment to intentionally come to terms with what is going on inside you. The
            favorite tool for this is moon journal. Simply sit yourself down, and surrender to you inner chaos. This
            will take time, you need to give yourself space to learn and get into the habit of meditating. But surely
            enough, after a few cycles of the moon, you will begin to see patterns in the emotions and feelings you go
            through during each phase. Be patient, be kind to your self and let things flow.
