        <h2>Meditating with the Moon</h2>
        <div class="moon-meditation-text">
            <p>Planet earth is not an easy place to live. It’s not easy when you feel misunderstood, betrayed, wronged,
                ignored, insecure, or less-than. It’s not easy when it feels like anxiety is getting the best of you,
                depression is ruling your life, or you feel disconnected from the world because of hurt you have
                experienced. Thankfully, the moon has the ability to draw out what we have absorbed from these
                hardships. This Moon Meditation will connect you with the moon’s powerful ability to heal your soul. </p>
                <br>
              <p>  I recommend repeating this Moon Meditation every day or every night, and even during the week of a full
                moon. Doing this meditation on a regular basis will make the benefits and effects more profound each
                time. If this Moon Meditation is part of your regular life, I recommend keeping track of the moon cycles
                and using that as a helpful tool. Having an awareness of the <a href="moon-phases.html"
                    class="active">lunar phases</a>
                can also be a helpful tool as it connects you even more with the moon. As you continue with this Moon
                Meditation, you will begin to see the moon differently and develop a relationship with the moon like you
                never have before. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The moon is your old friend, when you understand it and know how to lean on it, it won’t let you down.
                We need help that is not from this world and we can use the moon as our sanctuary with no worldly
                troubles. During this meditation, you are using the moon’s magnetic power to remove the poison from
                hardships from the center of your soul. This meditation puts you back in touch with your essence,
                realigns you, and helps rewire you. When you apply the right tools, freedom is in your hands and you can
                rise out of the ashes and heal deep-seeded emotional wounds.
