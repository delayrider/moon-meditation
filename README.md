## Design
- Hero image
  - The hero image was chosen on [Stockvault](https://www.stockvault.net/)
  - The choice of the hero image was made concidering the content of the website. Purple being associated with mysticism. 
  - The general atmosphere of the image is very calming and goes well with the subject of the page
- Color palette
  - The color palet for this website was chosen by running the hero image through [Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en)


## Current Features
 - Nav bar
   - The navigation bar is the same throughout the all four pages. 
   - The navigation bar elements are styled to highlight when the user hovers over them. This gives the user feedback as to where he can click. 
   - The active page is highlighted to give user feedback as to what page is currently being viewed.
   - The logo is linked to bring the user back to the home page. This does not highlight for esthetical purposes.

- Hero image
  - All four pages have the same hero image.
  - The image was chosen to reflect a calm and mystical feeling. The colour purple being associated with mistycism made the image a good fit for the style the page is going for. The clouds surrounding the moon give a nice "this to shall pass" vibe to the page which is very in tune with the main goal of mediation: letting go. 
  - The overlay on the hero image give site specific descriptions to what the page is about.

- Build a practice section
  - Instead of using a list to explain the four key notions of meditation, it was decided to go with four blocks. This makes the page more attractive and fun to look at.

- Lunar phase collapsible descriptions
  - Describing the eight lunar phases in one block of text separated by heading elements would have overcrowded the page with text thus reducing the overall user experience. 
  - In an effort to make the page more user friendly and interactive, collapsible texts were added for the descriptions of the lunar phases.

- Lunar phase emojis
  - To illustrate what each lunar phase looks like to the user, emojis were custom made for each phase. 
  - Due to limited time and skill these are imperfect and will not render on small screen. For more information about this please refer to the bugs section.

  - To give the user feedback on where to click to open the external links, the higlight on hover feature was added.
